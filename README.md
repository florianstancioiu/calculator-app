## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript superset
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - For testing
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

While watching the React tutorial from Udemy I learned some new stuff regarding unit testing and mocking existing functions in JavaScript.

### Continued development

1.  The calculator is not accessible to people that use only the keyboard to get around the application, I mean you can't use tab to move through the page, I would work on that.
2.  When I started writing the calculator functionality I missed a couple of things, one of them is to handle negative numbers, right now you can't insert negative numbers, only positive ones.
3.  The other thing that I omited is the fact that you can't chain operations, so you can't do 2 x 2 x 2, you have to do 2 x 2 and then 4 x 2 to achieve the same thing, I would handle that as well.
